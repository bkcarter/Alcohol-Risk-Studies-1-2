# Alcohol-Risk-Studies-1-2

This project is a small sample of some of my data analysis work. It contains an Rmarkdown file (AlcRisk.Rmd) that creates a tabbed html file (AlcRisk.html) summarizing the findings of two experimental studies investigating the effects of visual alcohol primes on gambling behavior (high risk vs low risk). This product was created for my collaborators who had a detailed knowledge of the studies, so explanation of results is minimal. However, I am happy to answer any questions regarding the project.
